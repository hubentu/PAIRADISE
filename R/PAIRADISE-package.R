#' PAIRADISE
#' Detecting allele-specific alternative splicing from population-scale RNA-seq data
#' 
#' We introduce PAIRADISE (PAIred Replicate analysis of Allelic DIfferential Splicing Events), a method for detecting allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) from RNA-seq data. PAIRADISE uses a statistical model that aggregates ASAS signals across multiple individuals in a population. It formulates ASAS detection as a statistical problem for identifying differential alternative splicing from RNA-seq data with paired replicates. The PAIRADISE statistical model is applicable to many forms of allele-specific isoform variation (e.g. RNA editing), and can be used as a generic statistical model for RNA-seq studies involving paired replicates.
